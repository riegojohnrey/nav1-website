            It is used for finding the right direction. Unlike magnetic compass, gyro compass is not hampered by an external magnetic field.  It is used to find the correct North Position, which is also the earthâ€™s rotational axis to provide a stable directional source. Its repeater system must be present in the steering platform for emergency steering.
